    This function builds a generator that will be used to give the necessary inputs to the label_to_image model: the
    input label maps, as well as the means and stds defining the parameters of the GMM (which change at each minibatch).
    :param path_label_maps: list of the paths of the input label maps.
    :param n_labels: number of labels in the input label maps.
    :param batchsize: (optional) numbers of images to generate per mini-batch. Default is 1.
    :param n_channels: (optional) number of channels to be synthesised. Default is 1.
    :param subjects_prob: (optional) relative order of importance (doesn't have to be probabilistic), with which to pick
    the provided label maps at each minibatch. Must be a 1D numpy array, as long as path_label_maps.
    :param generation_classes: (optional) Indices regrouping generation labels into classes of same intensity
    distribution. Regrouped labels will thus share the same Gaussian when sampling a new image. Can be a sequence or a
    1d numpy array. It should have the same length as generation_labels, and contain values between 0 and K-1, where K
    is the total number of classes. Default is all labels have different classes.
    :param prior_distributions: (optional) type of distribution from which we sample the GMM parameters.
    Can either be 'uniform', or 'normal'. Default is 'uniform'.
    :param prior_means: (optional) hyperparameters controlling the prior distributions of the GMM means. Because
    these prior distributions are uniform or normal, they require by 2 hyperparameters. Thus prior_means can be:
    1) a sequence of length 2, directly defining the two hyperparameters: [min, max] if prior_distributions is
    uniform, [mean, std] if the distribution is normal. The GMM means of are independently sampled at each
    mini_batch from the same distribution.
    2) an array of shape (2, K), where K is the number of classes (K=len(generation_labels) if generation_classes is
    not given). The mean of the Gaussian distribution associated to class k in [0, ...K-1] is sampled at each mini-batch
    from U(prior_means[0,k], prior_means[1,k]) if prior_distributions is uniform, or from
    N(prior_means[0,k], prior_means[1,k]) if prior_distributions is normal.
    3) an array of shape (2*n_mod, K), where each block of two rows is associated to hyperparameters derived
    from different modalities. In this case, if use_specific_stats_for_channel is False, we first randomly select a
    modality from the n_mod possibilities, and we sample the GMM means like in 2).
    If use_specific_stats_for_channel is True, each block of two rows correspond to a different channel
    (n_mod=n_channels), thus we select the corresponding block to each channel rather than randomly drawing it.
    4) the path to such a numpy array.
    Default is None, which corresponds to prior_means = [25, 225].
    :param prior_stds: (optional) same as prior_means but for the standard deviations of the GMM.
    Default is None, which corresponds to prior_stds = [5, 25].
    :param use_specific_stats_for_channel: (optional) whether the i-th block of two rows in the prior arrays must be
    only used to generate the i-th channel. If True, n_mod should be equal to n_channels. Default is False.
    :param mix_prior_and_random: (optional) if prior_means is not None, enables to reset the priors to their default
    values for half of these cases, and thus generate images of random contrast.
