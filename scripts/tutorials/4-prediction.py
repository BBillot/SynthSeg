This script shows how to perform inference after having trained your own model.
Importantly, it reuses some of the parameters used in tutorial 3-training.
Moreover, we emphasise that this tutorial explains how to perform inference on your own trained models.
To predict segmentations based on the distributed mode for SynthSeg, please refer to the README.md file.

# paths to input/output files
# Here we assume the availability of an image that we wish to segment with a model we have just trained.
# We emphasise that we do not provide such an image (this is just an example after all :))
# Input images must have a .nii, .nii.gz, or .mgz extension.
# Note that path_images can also be the path to an entire folder, in which case all the images within this folder will
# be segmented. In this case, please provide path_segm (and possibly path_posteriors, and path_resampled) as folder.
path_images = '/a/path/to/an/image/im.nii.gz'
# path to the output segmentation
path_segm = './outputs_tutorial_4/predicted_segmentations/im_seg.nii.gz'
# we can also provide paths for optional files containing the probability map for all predicted labels
path_posteriors = './outputs_tutorial_4/predicted_information/im_post.nii.gz'
# and for a csv file that will contain the volumes of each segmented structure
path_vol = './outputs_tutorial_4/predicted_information/volumes.csv'

# of course we need to provide the path to the trained model (here we use the main synthseg model).
path_model = '../../models/synthseg_1.0.h5'
# but we also need to provide the path to the segmentation labels used during training
path_segmentation_labels = '../../data/labels_classes_priors/synthseg_segmentation_labels.npy'
# optionally we can give a numpy array with the names corresponding to the structures in path_segmentation_labels
path_segmentation_names = '../../data/labels_classes_priors/synthseg_segmentation_names.npy'

# We can now provide various parameters to control the preprocessing of the input.
# First we can play with the size of the input. Remember that the size of input must be divisible by 2**n_levels, so the
# input image will be automatically padded to the nearest shape divisible by 2**n_levels (this is just for processing,
# the output will then be cropped to the original image size).
# Alternatively, you can crop the input to a smaller shape for faster processing, or to make it fit on your GPU.
cropping = 192
# Finally, we finish preprocessing the input by resampling it to the resolution at which the network has been trained to
# produce predictions. If the input image has a resolution outside the range [target_res-0.05, target_res+0.05], it will
# automatically be resampled to target_res.
target_res = 1.
# Note that if the image is indeed resampled, you have the option to save the resampled image.
path_resampled = './outputs_tutorial_4/predicted_information/im_resampled_target_res.nii.gz'

# After the image has been processed by the network, there are again various options to postprocess it.
# First, we can apply some test-time augmentation by flipping the input along the right-left axis and segmenting
# the resulting image. In this case, and if the network has right/left specific labels, it is also very important to
# provide the number of neutral labels. This must be the exact same as the one used during training.
flip = True
n_neutral_labels = 18
# Second, we can smooth the probability maps produced by the network. This doesn't change much the results, but helps to
# reduce high frequency noise in the obtained segmentations.
sigma_smoothing = 0.5
# Then we can operate some fancier version of biggest connected component, by regrouping structures within so-called
# "topological classes". For each class we successively: 1) sum all the posteriors corresponding to the labels of this
# class, 2) obtain a mask for this class by thresholding the summed posteriors by a low value (arbitrarily set to 0.1),
# 3) keep the biggest connected component, and 4) individually apply the obtained mask to the posteriors of all the
# labels for this class.
# Example: (continuing the previous one)  generation_labels = [0, 24, 507, 2, 3, 4, 17, 25, 41, 42, 43, 53, 57]
#                                             output_labels = [0,  0,  0,  2, 3, 4, 17,  2, 41, 42, 43, 53, 41]
#                                       topological_classes = [0,  0,  0,  1, 1, 2,  3,  1,  4,  4,  5,  6,  7]
# Here we regroup labels 2 and 3 in the same topological class, same for labels 41 and 42. The topological class of
# unsegmented structures must be set to 0 (like for 24 and 507).
topology_classes = '../../data/labels_classes_priors/synthseg_topological_classes.npy'
# Finally, we can also operate a strict version of biggest connected component, to get rid of unwanted noisy label
# patch that can sometimes occur in the background. If so, we recommend using the smoothing option described above.
keep_biggest_component = True

# Regarding the architecture of the network, we must provide the predict function with the same parameters as during
# training.
n_levels = 5
nb_conv_per_level = 2
conv_size = 3
unet_feat_count = 24
activation = 'elu'
feat_multiplier = 2

# Finally, we can set up an evaluation step after all images have been segmented.
# In this purpose, we need to provide the path to the ground truth corresponding to the input image(s).
# This is done by using the "gt_folder" parameter, which must have the same type as path_images (i.e., the path to a
# single image or to a folder). If provided as a folder, ground truths must be sorted in the same order as images in
# path_images.
# Just set this to None if you do not want to run evaluation.
gt_folder = '/the/path/to/the/ground_truth/gt.nii.gz'
# Dice scores will be computed and saved as a numpy array in the folder containing the segmentation(s).
# This numpy array will be organised as follows: rows correspond to structures, and columns to subjects. Importantly,
# rows are given in a sorted order.
# Example: we segment 2 subjects, where output_labels = [0,  0,  0,  2, 3, 4, 17,  2, 41, 42, 43, 53, 41]
#                             so sorted output_labels = [0, 2, 3, 4, 17, 41, 42, 43, 53]
# dice = [[xxx, xxx],  # scores for label 0
#         [xxx, xxx],  # scores for label 2
#         [xxx, xxx],  # scores for label 3
#         [xxx, xxx],  # scores for label 4
#         [xxx, xxx],  # scores for label 17
#         [xxx, xxx],  # scores for label 41
#         [xxx, xxx],  # scores for label 42
#         [xxx, xxx],  # scores for label 43
#         [xxx, xxx]]  # scores for label 53
#         /       \
#   subject 1    subject 2
#
# Also we can compute different surface distances (Hausdorff, Hausdorff99, Hausdorff95 and mean surface distance). The
# results will be saved in arrays similar to the Dice scores.
compute_distances = True

# All right, we're ready to make predictions !!
